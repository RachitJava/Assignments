### Introduction

This assignment is part of [Course Name], and it involves implementing scheduling algorithms to manage the execution of processes. Two main scheduling algorithms are implemented: FCFS and Priority-Based Scheduling. The goal is to report average wait and turnaround times for various scenarios.

### Program Overview

The program is written in C and consists of the following components:

- `test.c`: The main program that initializes processes and calls the scheduling algorithms.
- `README.md`: This README file that provides an overview of the assignment.

### Usage

To use this program:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```shell
git clone [repository URL]
